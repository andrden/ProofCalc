$? ( x * sh ψ + c * t * ch ψ ) ^ 2 - ( x * ch ψ + c * t * sh ψ ) ^ 2

We we later can test for unneeded rules easily - just by trying to remove rules one by one and seeing if we can still
run all the remaining rules in math.txt. Thus we can see which ones are still essential and which are disposable
and could be derived easily by ProofCalc itself.
